# Advice generator app

A simple and fully responsive web application that generates random advice using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app fetches data from the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) and displays it in an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface.

The app is built using a mobile-first approach and optimized for different screen sizes. Flexbox and media queries are used to ensure responsiveness.

This app uses the Advice Slip API to fetch random advice. The data is retrieved using a simple fetch request in JavaScript.

##### API Response:

```
{
  "slip": {
    "id": 42,
    "advice": "Don't forget to take breaks while working."
  }
}
```

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
